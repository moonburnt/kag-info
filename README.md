*I just wanted to get list of active King Arthur's Gold servers without requirement to open discord*

**Usage**:

`python ./kag-info.py`

**Screenshots**:

![Example Output](https://files.catbox.moe/1d2nh4.png?raw=true)

**Limitations**:

- Doesnt inform you about the country, server is located in. Maybe will add that someday, idk
- Doesnt show server's description. Trust me, you dont wanna see it the way, we receive it - blame kag api for that
- Servers in output arent organized by amount of players on them. Maybe will fix that
- Well, its terminal application. No fancy gui, no fancy pictures. I may add wxpython gui, if I will get interested enough to learn it
