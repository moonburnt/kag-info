*I just wanted to get list of active King Arthur's Gold servers without requirement to open discord*

**Dependencies**:

- python 3.6+ (will probably work on older versions, didnt test it)
- python-requests

**Usage**:

`python ./kag-info.py`

**Screenshots**:

![Example Output](https://files.catbox.moe/nrvu4h.png?raw=true)

**Limitations**:

- Doesnt inform you about the country, server is located in. Maybe will add that someday, idk
- Doesnt show server's description. Trust me, you dont wanna see it the way, we receive it - blame kag api for that
- Well, its terminal application. No fancy gui, no fancy pictures. I may add wxpython gui, if I will get interested enough to learn it
